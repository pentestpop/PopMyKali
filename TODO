# Automate the installation of the ANSIescape package, but I am not sure how.

1. Install the Package Control package using the Menu (or CTRL+Shift+P):

        Open the Tools menu
        Select Install Package Controlâ€¦

2. Use Package Control to install the ANSIescape package:

    Ctrl + Shift + P --> type "install", select "Package Control: Install Package" --> wait a few seconds, and a new search bar will pop up.
    In the new search bar --> search for "ANSIescape" and select it.
    Watch the status bar in the very bottom to see when it's done installing. It should just take a few seconds. Done!

3. Use it by clicking the current syntax highlighting text in the very bottom right of your Sublime Text 3 window. Choose "ANSI", as shown below. You may also choose this from the menus: View --> Syntax --> ANSI.

4. Fix background image and xfce settings which are out of date
5. fix server folder going to /root/server rather than /home/$user/server
